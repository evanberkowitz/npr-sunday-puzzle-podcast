## The NPR Sunday Puzzle

[The Sunday Puzzle][npr] is a feature on [Weekend Edition Sunday][weekend-edition-sunday]
where a contestant plays an on-air quiz with [Will Shortz][shortz].

The puzzle _used_ to be available as a podcast.  But, for whatever reason, NPR
stopped offering it in podcast form factor.  It is available as [an RSS feed][npr-rss]
but without the audio, it does not do me much good---I need those sweet sweet
puzzles piped directly into my ears.
